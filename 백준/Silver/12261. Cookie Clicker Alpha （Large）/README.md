### 문제 설명

<p>In this problem, you start with 0 cookies. You gain cookies at a rate of 2 cookies per second, by clicking on a giant cookie. Any time you have at least <strong>C</strong> cookies, you can buy a cookie farm. Every time you buy a cookie farm, it costs you <strong>C</strong> cookies and gives you an extra <strong>F</strong> cookies per second.</p>

<p>Once you have <strong>X</strong> cookies that you haven't spent on farms, you win! Figure out how long it will take you to win if you use the best possible strategy.</p>

<p>Example</p>

<p>Suppose <strong>C</strong>=500.0, <strong>F</strong>=4.0 and <strong>X</strong>=2000.0. Here's how the best possible strategy plays out:</p>

<ol>
	<li>You start with 0 cookies, but producing 2 cookies per second.</li>
	<li>After <strong>250</strong> seconds, you will have <strong>C</strong>=500 cookies and can buy a farm that produces <strong>F</strong>=4 cookies per second.</li>
	<li>After buying the farm, you have 0 cookies, and your total cookie production is 6 cookies per second.</li>
	<li>The next farm will cost 500 cookies, which you can buy after about <strong>83.3333333</strong> seconds.</li>
	<li>After buying your second farm, you have 0 cookies, and your total cookie production is 10 cookies per second.</li>
	<li>Another farm will cost 500 cookies, which you can buy after <strong>50</strong> seconds.</li>
	<li>After buying your third farm, you have 0 cookies, and your total cookie production is 14 cookies per second.</li>
	<li>Another farm would cost 500 cookies, but it actually makes sense not to buy it: instead you can just wait until you have <strong>X</strong>=2000 cookies, which takes about <strong>142.8571429</strong> seconds.</li>
</ol>

<p>Total time: 250 + 83.3333333 + 50 + 142.8571429 = 526.1904762 seconds.</p>

<p>Notice that you get cookies continuously: so 0.1 seconds after the game starts you'll have 0.2 cookies, and π seconds after the game starts you'll have 2π cookies.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, <strong>T</strong>. <strong>T</strong> lines follow. Each line contains three space-separated real-valued numbers: <strong>C</strong>, <strong>F</strong> and <strong>X</strong>, whose meanings are described earlier in the problem statement.</p>

<p><strong>C</strong>, <strong>F</strong> and <strong>X</strong> will each consist of at least 1 digit followed by 1 decimal point followed by from 1 to 5 digits. There will be no leading zeroes.</p>

<p>Limits</p>

<ul>
	<li>1 ≤ <strong>T</strong> ≤ 100.</li>
	<li>1 ≤ <strong>C</strong> ≤ 10000.</li>
	<li>1 ≤ <strong>F</strong> ≤ 100.</li>
	<li>1 ≤ <strong>X</strong> ≤ 100000.</li>
</ul>

### 출력 

 <p>For each test case, output one line containing "Case #x: y", where x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y is the minimum number of seconds it takes before you can have <strong>X</strong> delicious cookies.</p>

<p>We recommend outputting y to 7 decimal places, but it is not required. y will be considered correct if it is close enough to the correct number: within an absolute or relative error of 10<sup>-6</sup>.</p>

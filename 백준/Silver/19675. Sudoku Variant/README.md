### 문제 설명

<p>Sudoku is a famous logic puzzle game that is played on a 9x9 grid. In it, the player is required to fill in the grid so that every row, column and 3x3 box contains the digits 1 through 9. In this problem, you will be working on a variant of this puzzle which is played on a 3x3 grid.</p>

<p>Similar to Sudoku, the 3x3 grid you are given is already partially filled with the digits 1 through 9. Your job is to fill in the remaining empty grid positions with the digits 1 through 9 such that the numbers that appear in every row and every column are distinct, i.e. a number cannot be repeated along a row or column.</p>

<p>In the given grid there are at least 1 empty grid position and at most 3 empty grid positions, you may assume that the partially filled grid is consistent with the rules, i.e. no number is duplicated on any row or column. You are required to determine the number of ways the empty positions can be filled.</p>

### 입력

<p>In one move, the black player places a black piece into an empty square so that, in at least one of eight directions (up, down, left, right and the four diagonal directions), there is a row of white pieces between the newly placed piece and some other black piece. After placing, all white pieces between (in any direction) the newly placed black piece and pre-existing black pieces become black. </p>

<p>Write a program that, for a given board layout, calculates the largest number of white pieces the black player can convert in one move. </p>

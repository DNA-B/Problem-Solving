### 문제 설명

<p>Poor Bessie has taken a job in the convenience store located just over the border in Slobbovia. Slobbovians use different coinages than the USA; their coin values change day-by-day!<br>
 <br>
Help Bessie make optimal change for Slobbovian shoppers. You will need to create C (1 <= C <= 1000) cents of change using N (1 <= N <= 10) coins of various values. All test cases will be solvable using the supplied coins.</p>

<p>If 5 coins of values 50, 25, 10, 5, and 1 were available, Bessie would make optimum change (minimal coins) of 93 cents by using 1 x 50, 1 x 25, 1 x 10, 1 x 5, and 3 x 1 coins (a total of 7 coins).<br>
 <br>
How hard could it be? The final two test cases will be challenging.</p>

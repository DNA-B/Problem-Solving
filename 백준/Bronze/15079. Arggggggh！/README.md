### 문제 설명

<p>Congratulations! You’ve just inherited a treasure map from a long deceased ancestor who just happened to be a pirate. With visions of gold doubloons and jeweled cutlasses dancing in your head you carefully unfold the map. However instead of the standard picture map with a large X where the treasure is, this map is simply a list of instructions on where to start digging. The first instruction is the starting location, given as two integers x y giving the starting point’s latitude and longitude. After this are instructions like N 7 or SW 6 which specify to walk 7 feet north or 6 feet southwest. After following all of these instructions you will be located over the spot to start digging.</p>

<p>(Just to be clear, moving north increases the y value of your location and keeps the x value constant; moving east increases the x value of your location and keeps the y value constant. You can determine the effects the other directions have on the location.)</p>

<p>Now, you could go through the laborious task of executing each of the instructions one at a time, starting at the initial location, but it would be a lot easier to just calculate the final location and head right there. And that’s the task for this problem.</p>

<p>Oh, one more thing: turns out your ancestor was actually a Pittsburgh Pirate, and the treasure consists of a bunch of old baseballs and a really moldy mitt. I’m sure you can get a doubloon or two for them on eBay.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>Input starts with a line containing a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) indicating the number of instructions. The next n lines each contain a single instruction. The first instruction consists of two integers x y (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 100) indicating the starting point. The remaining instructions are of the form dir d, were dir is the direction (either N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W or NW) and d (1 ≤ d ≤ 100) is the distance to walk.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Display the x and y coordinates of the final location, separated by a single space. All coordinates should have a maximum relative or absolute error of 10<sup>−6</sup>.</p>
